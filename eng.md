I'd like to discuss about the "Out with the old, in with the new".

Sometimes, you need to drop off the old things to accept the new ones. 
Otherwise, you do not have the space to place the new ones, and you have to keep 
to use the old ones which does not meet your requirement already.
Such as clothes, shoes, laptops, and even a job.

When should you "out with the old"? In my experience, 
I suggest you do the "Out" when you thinking about if should I have a new one at the third time. 
During the first two times, you can think more about if you really need a new one.
And at the third time, just let it go and get a new one. It absolutely dose not meet your requirement.

So do a proper "Out with the old, in with the new" to refresh your life.

I'd like to discuss about the "Out with the old, in with the new". 
Sometimes, we must let go of the old to make room for the new. If we hold onto things that no longer serve us, 
we limit our ability to grow and upgrade, such as clothes, shoes, jobs, or even habits.

When should You "out with the old" ?
From my experience, a good rule is to "out with the old" when you find yourself considering a replacement for the third time. 

Here’s why:
The first time you think about replacing something, it might just be a passing thought.
The second time, you should evaluate whether you truly need an upgrade.
By the third time, it’s clear that the old no longer meets your needs—so it’s time to move on.

Holding onto outdated things (or situations) can hold you back. Instead, making timely changes keeps your life fresh and aligned with your current goals.
So, don’t hesitate—when the time comes, release the old, welcome the new, and move forward!
