I'd like to discuss about the topic "Out with the old, in with the new". 

Sometimes, we must let go of the old to make room for the new one. If we hold onto things that no longer serve us, we cannot grow or upgrade, such as clothes, shoes, jobs, or even habits.

When should we follow "out with the old" ?

From my experience, a good rule is to "out with the old" when you consider a replacement for the third time. 

Here is the why: 
The first time you think about replacing something, it might just be a passing idea.

So for the second time, you should take more time to evaluate whether you truly need a replacement.

By the third time, it’s clear that the old no longer meets your needs — 

So it’s time to move on, don’t hesitate to drop the old, and welcome the new!
