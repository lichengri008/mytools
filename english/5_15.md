I'd like to discuss about the "Out with the old, in with the new". 
Sometimes, we must let go of the old to make room for the new. If we hold onto things that no longer serve us, 
we limit our ability to grow and upgrade, such as clothes, shoes, jobs, or even habits.

When should you to "out with the old" ?

From my experience, a good rule is to "out with the old" when you find yourself considering a replacement for the third time. 

Here’s why:
The first time you think about replacing something, it might just be a transient idea.
So for the second time, you should take more time to evaluate whether you truly need an upgrade.
By the third time, it’s clear that the old no longer meets your needs—so it’s time to move on.

So, don’t hesitate—when the time comes, release the old, welcome the new, and move forward!
