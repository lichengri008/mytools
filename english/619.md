# The Power of Saying “No”
### Frequency vs. Impact – What Really Matters?
*By [Your Name]*

---

## The Central Question

- Say “no” more often → Protect time, reduce overload  
- Say “no” to bigger things → Preserve focus, avoid misalignment  
- 🧠 When did you last say “no”?

**Speaker Notes:**  
Hi everyone, today I want to explore a question we’ve all faced:  
Should we say “no” more often, or is it more important to say “no” to *bigger* things?

Let’s unpack both sides of this.

---

## Saying “No” More Often

### ✅ Pros
- Sets boundaries
- Reduces distractions
- Supports daily focus

### ⚠️ Cons
- Missed opportunities
- Constant mental filtering

**Speaker Notes:**  
Saying “no” more often helps guard our energy and reduce overload.  
But we might miss out on unexpected opportunities or burn out from constant filtering.

---

## Saying “No” to Bigger Things

### ✅ Pros
- Clarity about priorities
- Frees time and energy
- Long-term alignment

### ⚠️ Cons
- Emotionally difficult
- Feels risky in the short-term

**Speaker Notes:**  
Big “no”s are about life direction.  
Turning down the wrong job, wrong project, or wrong relationship may be tough—but they free you to focus on what matters most.

## Why Big “No”s Matter Most

> “You can’t say yes to the right things if you never say no to the wrong big ones.”

- Small “no”s protect time  
- Big “no”s shape your future

**Speaker Notes:**  
The no’s that define our path are usually the big ones.  
They’re difficult, but powerful.  
This quote captures it perfectly—our best yes requires strategic no’s.

## Your Challenge

### Try this:
- Say “no” to one big thing this month
- Reflect: What opened up as a result?

**Speaker Notes:**  
Here’s a practical takeaway: try saying no to *one* big thing this month.  
Maybe it’s a draining commitment or a misaligned goal.  
Notice what opens up after.

In the end, saying “no” isn’t just rejection—it’s redirection.

# Thank You!

**Speaker Notes:**  
Thanks for listening.  
Whether you say no more often or to bigger things, the power lies in being intentional.  
So—what will *you* say no to next?
