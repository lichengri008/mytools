Hello everyone, my name is xxx. Today, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.

I was born in Heilongjiang Province, located in the far northeast of China. 
It's known as China's coldest province, with an average annual temperature of just 4-5°C (Degree Celsius) and winter temperatures dropping below -30°C. 

I lived there until graduating high school, then I was admitted to Huazhong Agricultural University — one of the "211 Project" universities in Wuhan, Hubei. 

Wuhan is one of China's famously hotest cities. You can imagine how i was supprised when I arrived at the hottest city from the coldest place of China.

Over my four years of study in Wuhan, I gradually adapted and grew to love the City. I love Wuhan's foods, sceneris and cultures.

In my senior year, I interned at Citigroup Software. 
After about a year there, I moved to SAP—a global leader ERP software company — where I worked for six years. 
Later, I moved to Blackboard, an American learning system software provider. 
After two years at Blackboard, I joined my current company, eBay, where I've now been happily employed for six years.

So that all about me, a passionate software engineer. I feel so lucky to do work what I love.
