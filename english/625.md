Today I want to discuss the topic that why do you think many consumers are suspicous of corporate branding and advertising messsages ?

#1. Overexposure: People see ads everywhere all the time — online, on TV, in apps, on the street. 
This constant exposure can get people annoying and cause people to start ignoring or doubting them.

#2. Exaggeration: Ads often show products and experiences in an ideal or unrealistic way. 
People know that brands might not tell the whole truth or play on their emotions to get them to buy.

#3. Past Lies: There have been many well-known cases where companies lied or hide problems with their products. These stories have made people lose trust.

In short, people are suspicious because they’ve learned that ads are carefully crafted and they don’t always tell the truth.
