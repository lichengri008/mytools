I'd like to disscuss about the topic "How can companies help workers prevent burnout and promote work-life balance ?"

I think there are several ways: 

The first way would be creating reasonable work plans with some buffer time to prevent employees from experiencing excessive pressure.

Secondly, monitor employees' use of time off, and encourage them to take some rest when someone has been working continuosly for a long time.

The thrid one is offering flexible work arrangements, like remote work or flexible hours, to accommodate different personal needs and lifestyles.

Last but not least, regularly organize events to help employee relieve stress, like coffee breaks, wellness workshops or family days.
